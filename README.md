# Temperature Converter

I have developed a basic temperature converter website using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.This website provides a user-friendly platform for easily converting temperatures between various units, such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Users can input a value in one unit and instantly see the equivalent temperature in other units.

    =>HOW TO USE :-

    1. Enter the temperature you want to convert in the "Enter temperature" input field.
    2. Select the unit of temperature you are converting from in the "From" dropdown.
    3. Select the unit of temperature you want to convert to in the "To" dropdown.
    4. Click the "Convert" button to see the converted temperature.
